## Who I am.

My name is Alan Hylands and I am a data analyst and writer from Northern Ireland.

## What I'm doing now.

![Zapier logo image](https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/7sYLMymQDinPKZQS77P4BX/9545150792946dbb3c3d48f0fd18b55a/Zapier_logo.jpg?w=1520&fm=jpg&q=30&fit=thumb&h=760)

I joined [Zapier](https://zapier.com) in early 2020, and am currently a **Staff Data Scientist**.

## What I've done.

I've worked in tech, data and analytics for the past 20+ years - building, reporting, analysing, managing, and mentoring.

I've covered varied sectors, mainly tech, financial services, healthcare, and e-commerce, and have led successful data projects in areas such as exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation and profiling, and customer lifetime value modelling.

## A little more background.

I studied Accounting at university and planned for a future in finance.

Then I found the internet, programming, and databases.

I started my first e-commerce development agency in 2003. Since then I have worked on a number of small business start-ups in e-commerce, analytics, marketing, online research, and content marketing.
   
I started a successful football website which gave me the opportunity to write professionally for the New York Times Company. (Want to find out how that came about? Check out my [I Want To Be A Football Writer When I Grow Up](/posts/i-want-to-be-a-football-writer-when-i-grow-up/) article.)

Quite unexpectedly, I was seduced into the corporate world of banking and financial services in the boom-time mid-noughties.

I spent over twelve years running Data and Analytics projects for a large UK and Ireland banking group. I worked my way up through the ranks, from senior data analyst to senior analytics manager to Head of Retail Commercial Excellence.

Then I decided that I'd had enough of management and wanted to get back into doing what I love best - **digging into data and telling stories about what I find**.

And that's what brought me to [Zapier](https://zapier.com).

## Anything else?

I also write [data articles](/tags/data/) to help folks become better data analysts, and I help them get started learning SQL with my online [SQL Crash Course](https://sqlcrashcourse.com).
