# Data Analyst and Writer from Northern Ireland

Currently I'm a Staff Data Scientist at Zapier.

I [write articles](/tags/data/) to help folks become better data analysts, and help them learn SQL with my online [SQL Crash Course](https://sqlcrashcourse.com).

I have been a <a href="/posts/i-want-to-be-a-football-writer-when-i-grow-up/">World Soccer editor</a> for About.com 
and The New York Times Company, 
and had articles published in <a href="https://medium.com/data-science/becoming-an-analytics-manager-isnt-a-promotion-c3f65bbd0d95">Towards Data Science</a>
and <a href="https://hackernoon.com/fewer-dashboards-more-analysis-63581970672c">Hacker Noon</a>.

You can read a collection of my <a href="/writing/">selected essays</a> here.
